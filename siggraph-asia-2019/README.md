This is my second demo! Really quick one, though I'm pretty happy with how it turned out considering everything.

This is a smol post-demo writeup to capture my thoughts.

## Lessons Learned

Having a bank of effects that you can plug in is really useful when you're trying to do things quickly. I've been building up my demo effects (and things from tweetcarts) for a long while now, and in trying to get out a partydemo  those were really useful.

I also learned just how fun demoparties are! Or at least the small demo event we had at SIGGRAPH Asia 2019 was. Met a bunch of awesome people, saw a bunch that inspired me to make this demo and try writing new effects... I'm really, really excited.

In terms of the prod, music's definitely the thing that's hardest for me. I can get something that works, but it takes a while. Maybe I should do a song a day for a while, try to build up my skills properly or something like that.

The demo format I've been using has been really useful, especially having the demo effects template and being able to easily take them essentially as-is and then plug them into the final scenes.

The music syncing method I've been using has its issues, though. I suspect it may be a Pico-8 issue given just how tempremental it can be, but it's still something that's going to make me nervous on future p8 prods. We'll wait for the next release and see how it goes -- I'm sure that I can make that code a bit more resiliant in future somehow.

Oh, and the biggest thing! It's real nerve-wracking to actually release something! Or at least it is for me. I need to be less precious about the things I build, e.g. actually finalise and release strike witchery one day rather than letting it sit at the back of my wip demo pile accumulating low-poly dust. Only way I'm gonna get better at making demos is finishing and releasing stuff, good or bad, so get all that bad stuff out so I can get to making stuff I'm properly proud of and all.
