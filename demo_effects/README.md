this is a collection of different effects. basically, `_template.p8` is a rough template that emulates the layout, variables, etc of one of my demo's scenes, in a simplified way. I can take that file, write a new effect on top of it, and then use that pretty easily as a proper scene in a future demo, or something like that~ this is mostly full of little fun runnable things, so feel free to play with what's in here!

as mentioned in the main repo, consider all this that I've created as CC0 public domain and feel free to use as desired :)
